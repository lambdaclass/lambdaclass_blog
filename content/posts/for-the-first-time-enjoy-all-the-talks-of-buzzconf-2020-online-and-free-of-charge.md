### Come see BuzzConf 2020, a software and data science conference, open and online for one and for all!

The third edition of BuzzConf will be held freely online via Zoom and Youtube live. We’re very proud of our speaker lineup, which covers a wide range of topics that expand the frontiers of our technical knowledge.

We will dive into the topics of functional programming, Julia, Python, data science, machine learning, observability, operating systems and more! We believe Functional Programming and Data Science are two of the most interesting topics in the field which will open many opportunities in the near future, and we want to bring the latest developments in these areas to the global community.

This conference is the result of a combined effort of private and public sectors from Argentina, which aspires to help the development of our country's technical capabilities while spreading and sharing knowledge with the world.

We thank the generosity of the speakers who agreed to donate their time and we hope you enjoy their talks as much as we will.

### María Vanina Martinez: “Symbolic Reasoning to model Sentiment and Knowledge Diffusion in Social Networks”

 _Social media platforms, taken in conjunction, can be seen as complex networks; in this context, understanding how agents react to sentiments expressed by their connections is of great interest. We show how Network Knowledge Bases help represent the integration of multiple social networks, and explore how information flow can be handled via belief revision operators for local (agent-specific) knowledge bases. We report on preliminary experiments on Twitter data showing that different agent types react differently to the same information — this is a first step toward developing symbolic tools to predict how agents behave asinformation flows in their social environment._

### Will Kurt: “The Limits of Probability”

 _Probability is an increasingly ubiquitous part of our daily lives, especially as developers, researchers and data scientists. It is easy to mistakenly think this powerful tool is all we need to understand our world. This talk will show how our current environment of global pandemic, political unrest and economic uncertainty forces us to face the limits of probability as a tool for reasoning and understanding. This talk will cover both practical examples of the limitations of probability as well as dive into the philosophical roots of these limitations to show that it cannot be our only means to engage with our world._

### Aditya Siram: “What FP Can Learn From Static Introspection”

 _What if compile time and type level programming in functional programming languages were easy, something you reach for without even thinking about it? What if you could debug type errors with a simple compile time print statement? Write highly flexible systems by being able to introspect into types at compile time? Pre-calculate large portions of your programs for great efficiency? Typed functional programming is a great and fun way to write resilient software, and as type systems have become more and more expressive in recent years, we are able to program sophisticated and useful properties at the type level for even better compile time safety. Just one problem: It is very difficult, requires advanced knowledge of the type system, the syntax is convoluted, the error messages are impenetrable, and it is nearly impossible to debug. This talk will dive into why we should steal static introspection from languages like Nim, and D, state-of-the-art imperative programming languages which can solve all these issues, make type systems much more approachable without losing any expressive power, and offer new design possibilities for functional programs._

### Sergio Chouhy: “Deeploying Deep Q Learning with Pytorch”

 _Many things are being said about Deep Reinforcement Learning, but sometimes it is really hard to know where to start. In this talk, I will tell you all about the basis of this algorithms and show you how to deploy Deep Q Learning from scratch using Pytorch. I will be also talking about industrial applications for this technology._

### Viral B. Shah: “Julia — A language for AI and much more”

 _The Julia language is now used by over half a million programmers worldwide. Created to solve the two language problem, Julia is demonstrating performance gains of 50x-100x for many data science tasks such as data loading, data processing, graph processing, machine learning and scaling. Robust support for modern deep learning and the ability to do differentiable programming in an intuitive way is quickly leading to Julia becoming the language of choice for AI workloads. My talk will discuss the origin story of Julia, the formation of the Julia community, and all the amazing things happening in the world of Julia._

### Chris Rackauckas: “SciML: How Language is Changing Scientific Research”

 _Scientific machine learning is a burgeoning field and its taking off in Julia. Why? The purpose of this talk is to dive into that question: how has language accelerated the development of Julia’s SciML ecosystem? The core is composibility through multiple dispatch. We will showcase how this feature is not only what makes standard Julia code as fast as C or Fortran, but also allows Julia to eschew the traditional idea of “machine learning frameworks” and instead have machine learning directly work on the standard functions and libraries of the whole Julia programming language. This language-wide differentiable programming then builds a foundation where existing climate models, helicopter simulations, and efficiency simulators for battery-powered airplanes can be instantly composed with new tools for machine learning, and we will demonstrate how this has changed the way that researchers in Julia do science._

### Pablo Fernandez: “Machine Learning in The Real World”

 _A tour of the last 3 years of my career where I’ve productionized 3 different machine learning projects on kind-of-a-big-company (Despegar). Some of the challenges faced, not only technical but also from a product standpoint, some of the pedagogical work needed to convince others of letting important decisions be made by a machine. Hopefully insights that help you bring your own models to production._

### Peter Alvaro: “What not where: why a blue sky OS?”

 _A world of distributed, persistent memory is on its way. Our programming models traditionally operate on short-lived data representations tied to ephemeral contexts such as processes or computers. In the limit, however, data lifetime is infinite compared to these transient actors. We discuss the implications for programming models raised by a world of large and potentially persistent distributed memories, including the need for explicit, context-free, invariant data references. We present a novel operating system that uses wisdom from both storage and distributed systems to center the programming model around data as the primary citizen, and reflect on the transformative potential of this change for infrastructure and applications of the future._
