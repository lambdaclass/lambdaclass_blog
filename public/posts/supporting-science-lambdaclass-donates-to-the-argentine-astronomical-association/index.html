        <p>At LambdaClass we believe that advancing science requires collaboration across disciplines and sectors. As part of our commitment to supporting scientific research and education, we recently made a donation to the <a rel="noopener external" target="_blank" href="http://www.astronomiaargentina.org.ar/"><em>Asociación Argentina de Astronomía</em></a> (Argentine Astronomical Association), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting astronomical research and knowledge in Argentina since 1958.</p>
<p>We were honored to receive the following letter of appreciation from the Association:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Dear Federico Carrone,</strong></p>
<p>We would like to express our deepest gratitude, and ask that you extend it to LambdaClass, for the generous annual donation of USD 10,000 to the Argentine Astronomical Association (AAA). This contribution will cover the two most significant annual expenses of our organization, which in some years account for up to 80% of our total budget:</p>
<p>a) The payment of the national membership fee to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for Argentine astronomers and physicists;</p>
<p>b) The annual contribution as a sponsoring country of the journal <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> (A&amp;A).</p>
<h3 id="why-does-iau-membership-justify-this-investment"><strong>Why does IAU membership justify this investment?</strong></h3>
<pre class="giallo" style="color: #E1E4E8; background-color: #24292E;"><code data-lang="plain"><span class="giallo-l"><span>    1. Access to travel grants for General Assemblies, Regional Meetings, and Symposia.</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    2. Active participation in the scientific structure of the IAU, with opportunities to hold leadership positions on the Executive Committee and to join Divisions, Commissions, and Working Groups, as well as to propose symposia.</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    3. Eligibility for IAU awards, which recognize scientific excellence and community engagement.</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    4. Access to development and outreach grants that support socially impactful projects and specialized training events.</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    5. Participation in global scientific resolutions and decision-making processes.</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    6. Regular newsletters from Divisions and Commissions, becoming an active member of the largest international community of professional astronomers.</span></span>
<span class="giallo-l"><span>    7. Promotion of astronomy in STEM education at all levels through the IAU Office of Astronomy for Education (IAU-OAE).</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="argentina-as-a-sponsoring-country-of-astronomy-astrophysics-a-a"><strong>Argentina as a sponsoring country of <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> (A&amp;A):</strong></h3>
<p><em>A &amp;A</em> is consistently ranked among the most prestigious journals in the field of astronomy and astrophysics worldwide. Publishing in it is considered a significant scientific achievement.</p>
<p>Its open-access model ensures that all articles are freely and immediately available globally, increasing both their visibility and citation potential.</p>
<p>Thanks to Argentina’s sponsorship, our astronomy community can publish in <em>A &amp;A</em> without additional costs or delays. Without this benefit, individual researchers would face fees of up to USD 2,000 per article.</p>
<p>Through its annual contribution LambdaClass will enable (primarily but not exclusively) the astronomers and physicists of the Argentine astronomical community to publish their articles at no additional cost in one of the most prestigious international journals of Astronomy and Astrophysics, while maintaining our contribution to the international scientific community.</p>
<hr />
<p>We believe in long-term investment in knowledge and curiosity-driven research. Like computer science, astronomy is built on rigorous thinking, open collaboration, and the pursuit of deeper understanding.</p>
<p>This donation is more than a gesture; it’s a recognition of the vital role that institutions such as the Asociación Argentina de Astronomía play in advancing science and education in our country, and a tribute to the people who make that work possible.</p>
<p>Civil and public institutions are only as strong as the societies that support and value them. By strengthening these institutions, we strengthen our collective future.</p>
